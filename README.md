# Node.js Projects

This collection of projects was my first contact with Node.js. Despite the relative simplicity of these projects, they allowed me to explore and gain a deeper understanding of several tools that are essential such as Node.js, NPM, Postman, OAuth2, JWT, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Venom, and some APIs.

I have chosen to focus on the development of more complex projects using Node.js like the creation of a Video Stream ([MERN](https://github.com/renanbotasse/mern-videostream)), which uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## [Weather Terminal](https://github.com/renanbotasse/nodejs-projects/tree/main/node-weather-terminal)
This project uses an API to show the temperature of the city you ask for. But just run on the terminal.  

## [Weather Website](https://github.com/renanbotasse/nodejs-projects/tree/main/node-weather-web)
For this I used the same API to show the temperature, but as a website, they request your localization and send the requirements for the API, the API returns the temperature, day, local, sunrise and sunset.

## [Loguin Terminal](https://github.com/renanbotasse/nodejs-projects/tree/main/node-loguin)
This project is more complex than the previews. I create a "login" platform from the terminal, using express, mongoose, JWT,  mongoDB,  postman, auth, and hash.

## [Loguin Website](https://github.com/renanbotasse/nodejs-projects/tree/main/node-server)
The same logic as the Loguin Terminal but with a friendly interface.

## [Whatsapp Bot (GPT/DALL-E)](https://github.com/renanbotasse/nodejs-projects/tree/main/node-whatsappGpt)
This one is special because I used for the first time Venom and made a intergrade of the API from OpenAI (Davinci and Dall-E) and Whatsapp.
